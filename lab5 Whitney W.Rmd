##Lab 5

Load in the data:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

acc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/fars2017/accident.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

person <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/fars2017/person.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

1)Create a data frame containing the persons who are fatally hurt in the accidents (see FARS manual and look up variable INJ_SEV)
```{r}

```

2)Create a data frame containing the most dangerous vehicle make in each state. The number of persons fatally hit in the vehicle make is used to assess the (non-)safety of a make. Make sure to handle the missing values appropriately. (look up variable MAKE)
```{r}

```

3)Create a map, and label each state with the most dangerous vehicle. Discuss the definition of the most dangerous vehicle, and what you find from the map. (Hint: Read the description for the STATE and COUNTY columns in the FARS manual. The state & county codes are Geographic Locator Codes (GLCs) from the General Services Administrationâ€™s (GSA) publication. Use readxl::read_xlsx to read in the GLCs.)
```{r}

```

4)Join the accident and person table (work out which variable(s) to use)
```{r}

```

5)Tally the number of accidents by day of the week (DAY_WEEK), hour of the day (HOUR) and gender (SEX). Visualize the results and explain what you find.

Answer:

```{r}

```

6)Now plot a choropleth map of the number of deaths on a county level. Also explain what you find.

Answer:

```{r}

```
